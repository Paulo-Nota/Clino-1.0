## Overview

**Clino** is a comprehensive desktop application that integrates clinoform analysis, graph data extraction, and multi-channel profile extraction tools. Designed for geologists, researchers, and data analysts, Clino empowers users to efficiently import, analyze, visualize, and export geological and graphical data with ease. Leveraging Python's `tkinter` library for the user interface and powerful data processing libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`, Clino offers a unified platform for robust data analysis and visualization.

## Features

### Clinoform Analysis

- **Easy Data Import**: Supports Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) and CSV (`.csv`) file formats.
- **Dynamic Clinoform Detection**: Automatically identifies clinoforms based on column naming patterns.
- **Advanced Curve Fitting**: Fits multiple models including Linear, Quadratic, Exponential, Gaussian, and Inverse Quadratic.
- **Interactive Plotting**: Visualize data and fitted models with customizable plot options.
- **Rollover Handling**: Automatic detection or manual selection of rollover points.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Calculates RÂ², RMSE, confidence intervals, slopes, concavity, and length, width, topset and foreset gradient.
- **Export Results**: Save analysis results to Excel files with organized sheets per clinoform.
- **Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of analysis processes and any errors encountered.

### Graph Data Extraction

- **Image Import**: Supports various image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and GIF.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Click on the image to add data points, set axes, and manage graphical elements.
- **Axis Setup**: Define X and Y axes by selecting points directly on the image.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract pixel-based data points and map them to graph coordinates based on defined axes.
- **Plot Visualization**: Generate and view plots of the extracted data within the application.
- **Customization**: Choose colors for data points and axis lines to enhance clarity and visual appeal.
- **Session Management**: Save and load sessions to preserve your work, including points, axes, and settings.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Easily revert or reapply actions to manage your data extraction process.

### Multi-Channel Profile Extraction

- **Profile Drawing**: Draw various profiles such as linear, circular, semicircular, spline, freehand, rectangular, and elliptical on images.
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Extract profiles from channels like RGB, HSV, Grayscale, and Composite images.
- **Measurement Tools**: Measure lengths between points and areas of selected regions directly on the image.
- **Image Filtering**: Apply filters like Blur, Sharpen, and Edge Detection to enhance image quality.
- **ROI Selection**: Define Regions of Interest (ROI) for focused analysis.
- **Particle Analysis**: Threshold and analyze particles within the image, counting and outlining them.
- **Plot Visualization**: Generate plots of extracted profiles with detailed statistical annotations.
- **Session Management**: Save and load projects to preserve profiles, settings, and analyses.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Easily revert or reapply actions to manage your workflow efficiently.
- **Export Data**: Save extracted profiles and measurement data to CSV files for further analysis.
- **Logging**: Maintain detailed logs of all actions and events for troubleshooting and record-keeping.
